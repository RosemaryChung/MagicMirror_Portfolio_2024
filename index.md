# MagicMirror
A "MagicMirror" is a reflective screen that functions as a mirror and shows electronic graphics.  The elements of the screen are fully customizable and can be used for anything you want. I have made my screen into a mindful learning mirror. 

# First Milestone

I started this project during another summer program abroad. This resulted in huge issues when connecting my devices to the same secure network because I had to register the Raspberry Pi as a non-standard device (essentially I couldn't navigate my Raspberry Pi remotely on my MacBook). I could only connect both devices to a public network- which was a problem since devices were not made discoverable by default (I assume for privacy reasons as it is a public network). I was using the wireless keyboard and the touchscreen to navigate everything (sadly my mouse was dysfunctional).

When I finally returned home, all connections went well so I could finally start remotely editing, removing, and adding modules to my MagicMirror Interface. 

The first module I tried to add was called MMM-JustForTodayMeditation but it was persistently giving me problems so I resorted to finding other modules to add on the assumption that the code for the JustForTodayMeditation was faulty, outdated, or wrong in some way. Following this, I added the MMM-LearnLanguage module and the MMM-BreathWork module. I doubled the LearnLanguage module just so I could have the dynamic of learning two words from different languages per day.

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone 

  
# Final Milestone

**Don't forget to replace the text below with the embedding for your milestone video. Go to Youtube, click Share -> Embed, and copy and paste the code to replace what's below.**

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE


# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
