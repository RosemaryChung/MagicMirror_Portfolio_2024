# MagicMirror
A "MagicMirror" is a reflective screen that functions as a mirror and shows electronic graphics.  The screen elements are fully customizable and can be used for anything you want. I have made my screen into a mindful-learning mirror.

# First Milestone

I started this project during another summer program abroad. This resulted in huge issues when connecting my devices to the same secure network because I had to register the Raspberry Pi as a non-standard device (essentially I couldn't navigate my Raspberry Pi remotely on my MacBook). I could only connect both devices to a public network- which was a problem since devices were not made discoverable by default (I assume for privacy reasons as it is a public network). I was using the wireless keyboard and the touchscreen to navigate everything (sadly my mouse was dysfunctional).

When I finally returned home, all connections went well so I could finally start remotely editing, removing, and adding modules to my MagicMirror Interface. 

The first module I tried to add was called MMM-JustForTodayMeditation but it was persistently giving me problems so I resorted to finding other modules to add on the assumption that the code for the JustForTodayMeditation was faulty, outdated, or wrong in some way. Following this, I added the MMM-LearnLanguage module and the MMM-BreathWork module. I doubled the LearnLanguage module just so I could have the dynamic of learning two words from different languages per day.



# Final Milestone

For the last milestone, I was mostly adding and customizing modules and figuring out how I wanted to display the mirror. 

I had two options for displaying the mirror: either using the 7" display sent by BlueStamp and adding a frame around it, or using a bigger monitor that isn't being used by anyone in my home. Initially, I wanted to use the bigger monitor because I thought it would embody more of a mirror than the small one would allow for. When I was applying the reflective film to the bigger screen, I couldn't apply it smoothly without bumps and bubbles. Because of this I just ended up applying the film on the smaller display instead. In the end, I quite prefer the smaller display since I now plan to use this mirror on my bedside table.

When I was adding new modules, I had issues with modules that had "var config". Every time I added them to my code, the display would not load, and as soon as I removed them everything started to work again. I was pretty bummed about that because I wanted to include a dad jokes module which I found super funny. On the topic of modules, when I was making the motion detection code for my proposed gesture-controlled Spotify module, I didn't realise the difference between the code for a motion sensor and for a USB webcam. Because of this, I ended up just scrapping the whole Spotify module and using a pre-existing motion detection module that uses the USB webcam to turn the screen display on/off.


# Code


```c++

let config = {
	address: "localhost",	// Address to listen on, can be:
							// - "localhost", "127.0.0.1", "::1" to listen on loopback interface
							// - another specific IPv4/6 to listen on a specific interface
							// - "0.0.0.0", "::" to listen on any interface
							// Default, when address config is left out or empty, is "localhost"
	port: 8080,
	basePath: "/",	// The URL path where MagicMirrorÂ² is hosted. If you are using a Reverse proxy
									// you must set the sub path here. basePath must end with a /
	ipWhitelist: ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1"],	// Set [] to allow all IP addresses
									// or add a specific IPv4 of 192.168.1.5 :
									// ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1", "::ffff:192.168.1.5"],
									// or IPv4 range of 192.168.3.0 --> 192.168.3.15 use CIDR format :
									// ["127.0.0.1", "::ffff:127.0.0.1", "::1", "::ffff:192.168.3.0/28"],

	useHttps: false,			// Support HTTPS or not, default "false" will use HTTP
	httpsPrivateKey: "",	// HTTPS private key path, only require when useHttps is true
	httpsCertificate: "",	// HTTPS Certificate path, only require when useHttps is true

	language: "en",
